Comprehensive Master Plan for a Reddit-Like Social Platform
Technical Stack Resolution
Our platform will be built on a modern React/Next.js stack with a focus on performance, developer productivity, and scalability. Below we clarify each layer of the tech stack, including the exact technologies (with versions), alternative options considered, the rationale for our choices, integration points between components, and any performance or scalability implications.
Frontend Framework – Next.js 15.4.2 (React 19): Next.js (with the App Router and React 19) is our chosen frontend and SSR framework. We will use Next.js 15.4.2 configured with React Server Components (enabled by default in the App Router) for optimal performance

. Alternatives Considered: We evaluated SvelteKit and Remix as modern meta-frameworks, as well as full-stack options like RedwoodJS (which includes a GraphQL API and Prisma). SvelteKit offers simplicity and very small bundles, but adopting a new framework and retraining the team would slow us down

. Integration: The Next.js frontend will integrate with our backend logic via Next API routes (or potentially a dedicated API layer, discussed below). We will use Next’s built-in routing for pages (e.g. pages for feed, subreddit, post detail, etc.) and possibly API routes for server-side actions. The frontend will consume data through React hooks that call our APIs and will use Next’s server-side rendering to deliver content quickly to users (especially important for anonymous visitors and SEO). We will also configure Next.js with Tailwind CSS and our state management solution (see below) to ensure a smooth developer experience. Performance & Scalability: Next.js is known to scale well on Vercel and similar platforms – pages can be cached globally via CDN and we can leverage ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) for expensive pages (like a cached version of the front page) to reduce load. The use of React Server Components means much of the rendering can occur server-side, sending minimal JS to clients and improving performance on slower devices

. As traffic grows, we can horizontally scale by running multiple Next.js server instances behind a load balancer or using Vercel’s serverless scaling. Next’s static file serving and image optimization will be used to handle media efficiently. In summary, Next.js gives us an optimal blend of developer productivity and performance, with alternatives not offering sufficient benefit to justify switching.

Styling – Tailwind CSS 3.x: We will use Tailwind CSS for styling, ensuring a consistent design system and fast UI development. Alternatives Considered: Other options included traditional CSS/SCSS (with CSS Modules or styled-components), as well as component libraries like Chakra UI or Material-UI. We chose Tailwind because it provides a utility-first approach that greatly speeds up styling changes and enforces consistency. Unlike heavy CSS frameworks, Tailwind’s JIT compiler will generate only the necessary CSS, keeping bundle size minimal
medium.com
. It also integrates nicely with Next.js (we will set up Tailwind via PostCSS as per Next.js docs). Rationale: Tailwind significantly improves development speed and reduces context-switching (no need to leave JSX to write CSS rules). It also has a strong community and many pre-built components we can leverage. Importantly, performance is a major reason: Tailwind produces extremely small CSS bundles by purging unused styles, often resulting in smaller overall asset size than hand-written or Bootstrap CSS
medium.com
. Tailwind’s atomic classes compress well and avoid the runtime overhead of CSS-in-JS solutions. Integration: We will configure Tailwind in our Next.js project (using tailwind.config.js and including the Tailwind directives in a global CSS). We’ll use utility classes in our JSX for rapid UI development. Tailwind works seamlessly with React and our chosen icon library (Lucide Icons), and we’ll use clsx/tailwind-merge utilities to dynamically combine classes. Performance & Scalability: Tailwind’s style generation occurs at build time, so there is no runtime performance hit. The resulting CSS is scoped only to what we use, which ensures fast loads even as the design grows. We will enforce using Tailwind’s design tokens (colors, spacing, etc.) to maintain a consistent brand identity. As the app scales, Tailwind’s utilities will prevent a proliferation of custom CSS and make it easy to implement theming or dark mode. The only potential downside is a slightly larger HTML due to many classes, but gzip compression largely mitigates this. Given the bundle size and performance benefits (Tailwind often produces the smallest transfer size compared to other CSS approaches
medium.com
), this choice is justified. State Management – React Hooks with TanStack Query: For client-side state, we will adopt a hybrid approach: localized component state managed by React, and server state managed by a data-fetching library (TanStack React Query). Currently, our prototype uses custom hooks (e.g. usePosts) to fetch data. We plan to enhance this by integrating React Query (v5) for caching, background refetching, and synchronizing server state. Alternatives Considered: We considered sticking with simple custom hooks or using SWR (a similar library by Vercel). We also evaluated more global state solutions like Redux or Zustand for client-side global data (e.g. user session info) but decided they might be overkill for the MVP. React Query provides a focused solution for server data. Rationale: React Query will greatly simplify handling asynchronous data. It offers out-of-the-box caching, stale-while-revalidate behavior, and mutation handling, saving us from writing a lot of boilerplate for data fetching and syncing
dev.to
. By using React Query for posts, comments, etc., we ensure that if multiple components request the same data, they share a single cached result (preventing duplicate network calls)
dev.to
. React Query also handles refetching data in the background when it goes stale, and provides hooks for error and loading states, leading to a better UX. For purely client-side state (like a toggled UI element or temporary form state), we will use React’s built-in useState/useReducer or context as needed, since introducing Redux or similar adds complexity without clear benefit at this stage. Integration: We will wrap our app in a QueryClientProvider at the root with a QueryClient configured. Data-fetching hooks (like useQuery and useMutation from React Query) will replace our custom hooks for posts, comments, etc., tying into our Next.js API routes or backend. For example, a useQuery(['posts', subreddit], fetchPosts) will fetch posts for a subreddit and cache them. On posting new content or voting, useMutation will be used, and we will invalidate relevant queries to update the UI. Performance & Scalability: React Query’s caching will improve perceived performance by returning cached data immediately on component mount (while fetching updates in background)
dev.to
. This means users see content faster (possibly slightly stale, then updated). It also reduces load on our servers by avoiding repetitive queries. As our data grows, we can configure cache eviction and pagination in React Query to handle large lists. If needed, we can integrate React Query with infinite scrolling or virtualization for long lists of posts. The library is well-tested to scale to large applications. Another benefit is that React Query can integrate with Next.js SSR (e.g. prefetching queries on server) which we might leverage to deliver fully rendered pages to crawlers or initial page loads. Overall, this approach balances simplicity and efficiency, avoiding a heavy global state library until it’s truly needed.
Form Management – React Hook Form 7 (with Zod for Validation): For handling form inputs (e.g. user registration, creating posts, comments), we will use React Hook Form v7 in combination with Zod for schema validation. React Hook Form allows us to manage form state efficiently with minimal re-renders, and Zod provides a declarative way to validate inputs both on client and server. Alternatives Considered: We considered Formik (a popular form library) and Yup (a schema validation library). Formik, while feature-rich, triggers more re-renders due to using controlled components and can be slower for large forms
joyfill.io
. Yup is a strong validation library but was not designed with TypeScript-first principles, which can lead to weaker type inference compared to Zod
blog.logrocket.com
. Rationale: React Hook Form is chosen for its performance and lean footprint. It uses uncontrolled components and the ref API to minimize re-renders, which is beneficial as our forms (especially the post editor or comment input) should feel snappy
joyfill.io
. It also has a small bundle size and straightforward integration with external schema validators
joyfill.io
. Zod is chosen as our validation library because it integrates seamlessly with TypeScript – schemas can infer static TS types, ensuring our form data types align between front-end and back-end. Zod is a TypeScript-first library providing strong type safety out of the box
blog.logrocket.com
, whereas Yup (though now TS-compatible) historically required more boilerplate for types. Zod also allows validating data on the server using the same schemas, reducing duplication. Integration: We will define Zod schemas for inputs like PostSchema, CommentSchema, UserRegistrationSchema, etc. On the client, React Hook Form will be set up with the Zod resolver, so that on submission, the Zod schema validates the data (giving instant feedback on any field errors). For example, the post creation form will call handleSubmit which uses Zod to validate that title, content, etc., meet requirements. On the server, we will also use these Zod schemas to validate incoming API requests (as an extra safety net) before processing, ensuring data integrity. This centralizes validation logic. Performance & Scalability: React Hook Form’s approach means even if a form has many fields (say future settings pages, or multi-step forms), updating one field doesn’t re-render the entire form, improving responsiveness. Zod’s parsing is fast and can handle complex schemas; for most user-facing forms (which have limited fields), performance will be a non-issue. As more forms are added, we maintain consistency by having a pattern of using RHF + Zod for all forms. This combination will reduce bugs (type mismatches or uncaught invalid input) and make forms accessible as well (RHF easily integrates with the native form elements, and we will ensure to use semantic inputs and labels for screen readers). Overall, using these modern libraries will streamline form development and eliminate common form-handling pain points. API Architecture – Next.js API Routes (RESTful JSON API): For the MVP, we will implement our server-side API using Next.js API routes (essentially Node.js serverless functions) to handle CRUD operations (posts, comments, votes, auth, etc.). This provides a simple way to keep our backend logic co-located with the Next app. Alternatives Considered: We considered adopting a GraphQL API (for example, RedwoodJS uses GraphQL + Prisma by default) or using a tRPC (TypeScript RPC) approach to have end-to-end type safety. We also considered splitting out a separate backend service using a framework like Express or NestJS. For the initial phase, Next API routes offer sufficient functionality without the overhead of maintaining a separate server or GraphQL layer. GraphQL could be powerful for complex querying across entities, but for a Reddit-like application the queries are fairly straightforward (list posts, get comments, etc.) which REST can handle well. Introducing GraphQL would also mean more up-front work (designing schema, setting up resolvers) which might slow MVP development. tRPC is an appealing alternative for type-safe APIs, but it’s a newer technology and would tie our backend closely to Next; given our team’s familiarity with REST and the need to possibly allow external clients in the future, a REST API feels more standard. Rationale: Next.js API routes give us a convenient, integrated backend that runs wherever we deploy our Next app (e.g. on Vercel or a Node server). We can easily create endpoints like /api/posts or /api/subreddits/[id]/moderate that correspond to needed functionality. This keeps deployment simple (one artifact) and leverages Next’s optimized serverless handling. Also, by using Next’s API routes, we ensure any server-side rendering and API calls are in the same codebase, making it easier to coordinate (for example, a page’s getServerSideProps could call an internal API route or directly query the DB). Integration: The API layer will interact with our database (via an ORM or query builder, likely Prisma or similar). Each API route function will validate the request (with Zod schemas where applicable) and then perform database operations. We will organize API route files by resource (e.g. pages/api/posts/[id].ts for individual post operations, etc.). For state changes like voting or posting, the frontend will call these API routes using fetch or React Query’s useMutation. Authentication will be integrated (we plan to use NextAuth, see below) so that API routes can identify the user from the request (NextAuth adds session info to Next API requests). We will ensure to handle errors consistently (returning JSON with error messages and appropriate HTTP status codes). Performance & Scalability: Using Next’s serverless API routes means each request is stateless and can automatically scale (e.g. Vercel will spawn multiple lambdas as needed for high traffic). There is some overhead to cold-start serverless functions, but for a moderate scale MVP this is acceptable. If we experience performance issues for certain endpoints, we can optimize by enabling caching at the CDN level (for GET requests, using Cache-Control headers) or consider migrating to a dedicated Node server if needed. For read-heavy data (like the home feed or popular posts), we might implement an in-memory cache (Redis) down the line, but initially we rely on the database and React Query caching on the client. We will design the API with pagination in mind for listing endpoints (to avoid sending huge data). Over time, if our API needs grow complex or we want to open it to third-party developers, we might introduce a GraphQL layer or switch to tRPC to maintain type safety – we keep this option open for future milestones but will not pursue it for the MVP due to time constraints. In summary, Next API routes provide simplicity and sufficient power for now, and we will monitor if/when we need to evolve this layer.
Database – PostgreSQL 15 (with Prisma ORM): For our primary database, we will use a relational database, specifically PostgreSQL 15.x. Postgres will hold all persistent data: user accounts, posts, comments, votes, subreddits, etc. We plan to use Prisma as an ORM to interact with Postgres in a type-safe way. Alternatives Considered: We looked at NoSQL options like MongoDB, which some projects use for its schemaless flexibility, and NewSQL/cloud databases (CockroachDB, etc.). However, the data in a Reddit-like app is highly relational (posts belong to users and communities, comments have parent-child relationships, votes aggregate per post, etc.), which suits a SQL database well. Postgres versus MySQL was considered; either could work, but Postgres has advanced JSON support (for flexibility if needed), robust indexing options, and is very reliable. Also, our team has more experience with Postgres. NoSQL (e.g. Cassandra or DynamoDB) might scale to massive write volumes, but at MVP stage this is premature optimization and would complicate querying (e.g. doing joins or aggregations for things like top posts would be harder). Rationale: PostgreSQL is a proven, general-purpose database that can handle our expected workload easily. It ensures data integrity through ACID transactions (important for things like counting votes or processing transactions if we later add e-commerce). It also has features like full-text search and indexing that we can leverage for search functionality without immediately requiring a separate search engine. The strong consistency model simplifies development – we don’t have to worry about eventually consistent data anomalies in the core features. Moreover, starting with Postgres does not preclude adding specialized stores later (we could add a Redis cache for hot data or Elasticsearch for advanced search while still using Postgres as the source of truth
reddit.com
). In fact, it’s common to use a general SQL DB like Postgres as the primary store and introduce other databases only for specific needs
reddit.com
. Integration: We will use Prisma ORM to manage the database schema and queries. Prisma will allow us to define our data models (User, Post, Comment, Subreddit, Vote, etc.) in a schema file and generate a TypeScript client. This means when our Next API route code queries the DB, we get type-checked results (e.g. prisma.post.findMany() returns a Post[] type). This reduces errors and aligns with our TS-first approach. Prisma also simplifies migrations – we can evolve the schema and have migrations generated to apply to the Postgres database. The database will be hosted via a managed service for ease (for example, Amazon RDS, Supabase, or DigitalOcean Managed PG). We’ll secure connections and use connection pooling (managed automatically by the platform or via a pool in our Node environment). In code, queries will be performed in our API route handlers: e.g. the GET /api/posts handler will call prisma.post.findMany({ where: { subreddit: ... }, include: { author: ..., voteCount: ... } }) to fetch posts along with relations. For writes, we’ll use transactions where needed (for example, creating a post might involve two inserts – one in Posts table, one in a separate table for the initial vote by the author). Performance & Scalability: A single Postgres instance will easily handle our initial user base (which in the first few months might be thousands, not millions, of users). Postgres can scale vertically (we can upgrade the instance) and to some extent horizontally using read replicas for heavy read load. We’ll design indices on critical fields (e.g. index on post.subreddit_id for fetching posts by subreddit, index on vote.post_id for aggregating votes, etc.). For full-text search on post titles or content, we can use Postgres’ text search or add an ElasticSearch in a later milestone if needed. By using Postgres now, we keep our development velocity high (no need to handle sharding or eventual consistency complexities). We also ensure data consistency – for example, referential integrity will prevent orphaned records (if a user is deleted, we can cascade delete their posts, etc.). We acknowledge that at Reddit’s massive scale, additional databases are used (Reddit uses Postgres plus Cassandra for certain workloads
www-staging.commandprompt.com
), but that is far beyond our MVP scope. Our plan is to start with Postgres which is almost always the right choice until proven otherwise
reddit.com
. This choice will be revisited if we approach significant scale or if certain features (e.g. real-time feeds, huge analytics) demand a different approach, but in the 3-4 month horizon Postgres is optimal. Authentication – NextAuth 4 (Auth0 or Email OAuth providers): We will implement user authentication using NextAuth.js (v4), a popular auth library for Next.js. NextAuth supports multiple providers (OAuth for Google/GitHub, email/passwordless, credentials, etc.) and integrates easily with Next’s App Router. Alternatives Considered: We considered rolling our own JWT-based auth system or using Firebase Authentication. We also looked at Supabase Auth (which comes with a hosted Postgres) or Auth0. NextAuth is chosen because it works directly in our tech stack and saves us from managing tokens manually. Rolling our own JWT auth would require building password reset flows, email verification, secure token storage – doable but time-consuming and risky for security. Firebase Auth is robust but would add an external dependency and the rest of our stack is not using Firebase, so it felt out of place. NextAuth gives us flexibility to switch strategies easily (for example, start with simple email link login, later add Google OAuth login with minimal changes). Rationale: NextAuth provides a secure, battle-tested authentication solution with minimal setup. It handles encryption of cookies, token refresh, etc., and stores session data server-side by default (or JWT if we prefer). Because our target users likely have existing accounts on other platforms, enabling quick sign-in via Google or GitHub can reduce friction. We’ll likely allow both email/password (or magic link) and a couple of OAuth providers. The library’s popularity means plenty of community support. Another benefit is NextAuth’s adapter system – we can store user accounts in our Postgres via a Prisma adapter, unifying our data. Integration: We will configure NextAuth in a /api/auth/[...nextauth].ts route. For initial implementation, we might use credentials provider (allowing users to sign up with username/email and password stored in our database). We will secure passwords with strong hashing (bcrypt). Alternatively, a passwordless “magic link” via email could be an option to simplify user onboarding (since our target is tech-savvy users who might appreciate not managing another password). We’ll also consider adding Google OAuth for quick onboarding – NextAuth makes adding it straightforward by providing a pre-built provider for Google. All user credentials and sessions will be stored in the database (NextAuth’s Prisma adapter will create tables for Users, Accounts, Sessions, etc.). On the client side, we will use NextAuth React hooks (useSession, signIn, signOut) to manage login state. For example, in the nav bar we’ll show login buttons if no session, or the user’s avatar if logged in. NextAuth will also allow protected API routes – we can build middleware or simply check session in API route handlers to ensure the user is authenticated for certain actions (like posting, voting). Performance & Scalability: Authentication requests (login, callbacks) are not heavy in volume compared to read operations, and NextAuth can handle them easily. We will take care to configure secure cookies (HTTP-only, same-site) for session tokens to prevent XSS attacks. Using NextAuth means we don’t have to worry about scaling a separate auth service; it scales as our Next.js scales. For very large scale, we might need to consider rate-limiting login attempts or using a faster session store (like Redis for session tokens), but at MVP scale, a Postgres-backed session is fine. We’ll also implement email verification for new accounts to ensure quality (NextAuth has flows for email verification if using email provider). In summary, NextAuth gives us fast integration and robust security for user accounts, letting us focus on core features. 
Testing Strategy – Jest and React Testing Library: We will adopt a comprehensive testing approach from early development. The stack already includes Jest and React Testing Library for frontend/component tests, and MSW (Mock Service Worker) for mocking API calls in tests. We will continue using these and expand our test suite. Alternatives Considered: For end-to-end (E2E) testing, we considered Cypress or Playwright. We plan to incorporate Playwright for full user flow testing once the application is stable enough (Playwright has good integration with Next and can test across browsers). No change is needed for unit/integration testing libraries, as Jest/RTL are standard and sufficient. Rationale: A solid automated testing setup is critical for maintaining speed as the codebase grows. Jest is a widely used framework that we already have configured. React Testing Library (RTL) encourages testing UI by simulating user interactions (clicks, typing) rather than shallow implementation details, which leads to more robust tests. MSW allows us to simulate backend responses in tests without flakiness. We considered Cypress for E2E; it’s very powerful for simulating a real browser, but since we might also leverage Playwright (which can handle E2E and is faster in CI for headless runs), we will decide on one of these for high-level tests. Integration: We will write unit tests for critical pure functions (e.g. helper utilities), component tests for UI components (using RTL to render and assert on DOM output given certain props/state), and integration tests for pages or flows (mocking network calls with MSW to simulate server data). For example, we’ll test the Post voting component to ensure clicking upvote increases the count, and that it calls the API (using MSW to intercept the /api/vote call). We’ll test form validation by simulating bad input and expecting error messages (which leverages our Zod schemas). For backend logic, we can use Jest to run tests against our API route handlers by mocking Prisma (or using a test database). Alternatively, we might set up an in-memory Postgres or SQLite with Prisma for realistic DB tests on critical queries. Once we have major user flows working, we’ll create E2E tests: for example, using Playwright to open a browser, navigate to the site, simulate a user signing up, creating a post, and seeing it appear. These E2E tests will run on a staging environment or via next start in CI. Performance & Scalability: A well-tested codebase prevents regressions, which is crucial as we iterate quickly. We will include tests as part of our CI pipeline so that every commit runs the test suite. Jest and RTL tests are fast; we anticipate a suite of a few hundred tests running in seconds to a couple of minutes in CI, which is acceptable. We will also monitor coverage to ensure we have good coverage on core logic (aiming for, say, ~80% coverage on critical files). By investing in testing, we mitigate technical risks and can confidently refactor or add features. This supports our fast-moving timeline by catching bugs early, rather than discovering them post-release. Deployment and DevOps – Vercel for Frontend & API, Cloud Database: Our deployment strategy is to use Vercel for hosting the Next.js application (frontend and API routes), along with a managed Postgres database (such as Supabase or AWS RDS). We will set up CI/CD such that every push to main branch triggers a deployment. Alternatives Considered: We considered self-hosting on AWS EC2 or using Docker containers in Kubernetes. Given our need for speed and low ops overhead, deploying to Vercel (which is built by the creators of Next.js) is ideal. Vercel provides instant global edge caching and automatic scaling for Next apps. Another alternative was Netlify or Fly.io, but Vercel’s tight integration with Next’s features (ISR, image optimization) is a strong advantage. For the database, options included running Postgres on the same host or using an embedded DB like SQLite for simplicity; however, for production an external managed Postgres is better for reliability and persistence. Rationale: Using Vercel means we get out-of-the-box support for Next.js features and do not worry about managing servers. It also offers preview deployments (every PR can have a unique URL), which will aid in testing and gathering feedback. This aligns with our iterative development approach. We don’t expect to need heavy customization that would warrant a more complex infrastructure at this stage. Integration: We will connect our GitHub repository to Vercel. On each commit to main (or when we trigger a release), Vercel will build the Next.js app, run our tests (if configured in build pipeline), and then deploy. Environment variables (for database connection, API keys, etc.) will be configured in Vercel’s dashboard. The Postgres database will run on a cloud provider; we’ll store its connection string securely. Our NextAuth secrets and any third-party API keys (for email or OAuth) will also be stored as secrets. For static files (images users upload, etc.), during MVP we can store them on the file system or database if small, but long-term we plan to integrate with an object storage (like S3 or Cloudinary) – we will likely include that in a later milestone. Vercel will handle CDN caching for static assets and our statically generated pages; we’ll configure cache headers for APIs if needed. Performance & Scalability: Vercel’s network ensures fast delivery via edge locations, meaning users globally will get good performance (e.g., our static JS and CSS and any cached pages served from nearest edge). The Next.js serverless functions scale automatically – if we have a traffic spike, Vercel will spawn more instances to handle API requests. This auto-scaling means we can handle sudden growth without immediate infrastructure changes. We should keep an eye on cold start times of serverless functions; for small APIs these are usually fine (tens of milliseconds). If any function becomes heavy (e.g. generating a huge report), we might need to optimize or use Vercel’s Edge Functions (which run on V8 isolates) or move to a persistent server. But likely we’ll be within the limits. We will also set up a staging environment on Vercel (perhaps using branch deployments) to test features internally before merging to main. For the database, to scale we can adjust the plan (more CPU/RAM) and eventually add read replicas. Regular backups will be enabled for the DB. Additionally, our deployment strategy will incorporate monitoring and alerts: Vercel has analytics for function invocation and response times, and we will integrate Sentry (described below) for error monitoring. Summing up, this approach minimizes DevOps overhead and leverages platform-as-a-service so the team can focus on development.
Monitoring & Analytics – Sentry and Custom Metrics: We will put in place monitoring for both application errors and performance metrics. Sentry will be integrated for error tracking on both client and server, and we will use Vercel/Next.js Analytics as well as custom logging for performance monitoring. Alternatives Considered: Other error monitoring tools like LogRocket or New Relic were considered. We chose Sentry due to its strong Next.js integration and free tier that likely covers our early needs. For analytics (user behavior), we can use a combination of simple tools: e.g. Google Analytics (GA4) for general page view tracking and perhaps a custom dashboard for community stats. Given our privacy-conscious audience, we may avoid heavy tracking and stick to aggregated analytics. Rationale: Sentry provides real-time visibility into uncaught exceptions and performance bottlenecks. It will catch errors in our Next.js API routes and front-end React code and alert us, so we can fix bugs before they affect too many users
vercel.com
. It also has performance tracing to identify slow database queries or API calls. This is invaluable for maintaining reliability as we iterate quickly. We want to catch issues early (especially in an MVP where everything is new). Integration: We will set up Sentry with Next.js – this involves installing the Sentry SDK and adding configuration in sentry.client.config.js and sentry.server.config.js. We will DSN keys and enable source map upload so we get readable stack traces. On the client, Sentry will capture React runtime errors; on the server, it will capture exceptions in API routes or getServerSideProps. We will also set up alert rules (e.g. notify via email/Slack if a new error happens X times). Aside from Sentry, we will implement basic logging on the server (using console or a library like pino) for key events (user signup, post created, etc.), and ensure those logs are retained (Vercel streams logs which we can download or connect to a logging service if needed). For analytics, we plan to embed a GA4 snippet to measure page views, session duration, etc., as a basic indicator of usage. Additionally, we will produce admin dashboards (perhaps within an admin panel) for metrics like number of posts per day, new registrations, etc., pulling from the database. These help us track growth and engagement (and serve as success metrics – see Success Metrics section). If usage grows, we might deploy more advanced observability: e.g. an APM (application performance monitoring) tool or database monitoring to detect slow queries. Performance & Scalability: Sentry’s overhead is minimal (it batches errors and doesn’t significantly slow the app). The insight it provides far outweighs any performance cost
vercel.com
. We will make sure to scrub sensitive data from logs/monitoring (especially PII in errors). Vercel’s built-in monitors will be used to watch deployment status and function invocations. As we scale, we may integrate uptime monitoring (a service pinging our site to alert if it goes down) and load monitoring on the database. For now, the plan is to have enough visibility into the system’s health that we can react quickly to issues, ensuring we maintain a stable platform for users. Monitoring and analytics will guide our optimization efforts – e.g., if we see page load time creeping up or a particular API is slow, we’ll target that in performance sprints.

The client (browser) makes requests to Next.js (which serves pages and handles API routes). Next.js server communicates with the PostgreSQL database (via Prisma ORM) to fetch or update data. Authentication is managed via NextAuth (with calls to third-party providers or internal database for sessions). Static assets and content are delivered via CDN. Monitoring tools like Sentry capture errors from both client and server, and all components are containerized in the Next.js app deployed on Vercel for easy scaling. This modular, integrated stack ensures each piece works seamlessly together and can scale by replicating the Next.js server and using managed services for the database and auth. In summary, our technical stack choices emphasize developer efficiency, type safety, and performance. We have resolved ambiguities by selecting specific tools: Next.js 15.4.2 for the frontend (with React 19), Tailwind CSS for styling, React Query for state management, Next.js API routes with Prisma/Postgres for the backend, NextAuth for auth, and robust testing/deployment/monitoring practices. Each choice was weighed against alternatives and optimized for a fast MVP delivery while laying a strong foundation that can scale. This cohesive stack will allow our small team to build a Reddit-like platform rapidly without sacrificing future extensibility or user experience.

User Types and Roles
Our platform will cater to several distinct user personas/roles, each with different permissions and usage patterns. We identify six primary user types: Anonymous Visitors, Registered Users, Moderators, Administrators, Content Creators, and Lurkers. Below we define each role, their capabilities and limitations, and how they interact with the platform.
Anonymous Visitors (Guest Users): These are users who have not logged in or created an account. Permissions & Capabilities: Anonymous visitors can browse all public content – they can view posts, comments, and subreddits freely. They can sort and search content, click on user profiles (viewing public info), and follow public links. Essentially, the reading/browsing experience is fully accessible without login (similar to how one can browse Reddit without an account). Limitations: Guests cannot participate in posting or voting. The UI for actions like “upvote” or “reply” will prompt them to sign up or log in. They also cannot access any personalized features (e.g. subscribing to communities, creating content, or receiving notifications). Usage Patterns: Many newcomers will start as anonymous lurkers, sampling the content before deciding to join. We expect a large portion of traffic to be anonymous, especially from search engine referrals or casual visitors. Ensuring a good read-only experience (fast page loads, no intrusive popups) is key to converting them into registered users. That said, certain communities or features might be hidden or limited to logged-in users if needed (for example, if we had a private subreddit concept or NSFW content filter – those would require login to verify age). But by default, an anonymous user should feel they can consume value immediately.
Registered Users (Basic Members): These are users who have created an account and are logged in. Permissions & Capabilities: Registered users form the core of the community. They can create new posts and comments, vote on posts and comments (upvote/downvote), and subscribe to subreddits to personalize their feed. They can also create new subreddits (communities) on topics of interest (unless we decide to restrict community creation at MVP launch to admins or a beta group). They have profiles where they can set an avatar, bio, and view their own post/comment history. They can send and receive private messages or chat (if that feature is enabled in a later milestone). Registered users can also report content that violates rules, using a report feature that flags to moderators/admins. Essentially, they have full participation rights in public areas of the site. Limitations: Basic users are subject to community rules and anti-abuse limits. For example, a new account might have rate limits on posting (to prevent spam), or minimum karma requirements for certain actions if we introduce that. They cannot moderate others (no deletion of others’ content except on their own posts if they delete their thread or comment thread they started). They also cannot see any administrative dashboards or private moderator discussions. Expected Usage Patterns: Registered users are the life of the platform – they will range from casual contributors (maybe commenting occasionally) to very active daily posters. We anticipate perhaps ~10% of our registered users will create the majority of content (as per the “90-9-1” rule, a small percentage of users account for most contributions
nngroup.com
). Features like karma or reputation will apply to these users, but at MVP, we’ll at least track their post counts, upvotes, etc. Registered users will enjoy a personalized feed/homepage containing updates from their subscribed communities, which should encourage daily engagement. Ensuring the workflow for posting, commenting, and voting is smooth and rewarding (through feedback like vote counts updating in real-time) will keep these users active.
Moderators (Community Moderators): Moderators are users (typically volunteers) who manage individual subreddits (communities). Permissions & Capabilities: A moderator has elevated rights within their specific subreddit(s). They can remove or approve posts and comments in their community that violate rules, ban or mute users from participating in that subreddit, and edit the subreddit’s settings (like description, rules, and appearance such as community banner or theme if supported). Moderators can also pin posts to the top of their subreddit (important announcements, for example). They might have access to a moderation queue of reported or flagged content. If we implement automoderation tools (like word filters), mods can configure those for their community. Becoming a moderator happens either by creating a new community (the creator is a mod by default) or being appointed by an existing mod or admin. We will include a feature for moderators to invite or add other users as mods to help manage a growing community. Limitations: Moderators’ powers are confined to their own subreddit – they cannot moderate global content or other communities they are not a mod of. They also cannot change core platform settings or ban users site-wide (that’s for admins). Moderators must abide by site-wide policies as well; if a mod misbehaves (e.g., allowing illegal content), admins might intervene or remove them. Expected Usage Patterns: Moderators are typically power users who are deeply engaged with their community’s topic. They might spend significant time reviewing new posts, answering questions, and enforcing rules. We anticipate that mods will be a small fraction of users but very important for maintaining quality. For instance, if each community has a couple of mods, and an active user becomes a mod after building trust, they transition into this role. We should support them with good moderation tools (both on web and possibly mobile) to ease their volunteer work. According to Reddit’s model, moderators collectively contribute a tremendous amount of unpaid work keeping communities civil
en.wikipedia.org
en.wikipedia.org
. We should recognize their contributions and ensure our platform is mod-friendly to attract community leaders. (We will likely create a Moderation Guidelines document as part of our charter, to clarify expectations and give mods autonomy similar to Reddit’s approach where “moderators...manage their communities, set and enforce rules”
en.wikipedia.org
.)
Administrators (Platform Admins): Administrators are the platform’s own staff or super-users with full oversight capabilities. Permissions & Capabilities: Admins have site-wide powers – they can access any subreddit (even private ones), remove content or users across the platform, and manage the platform’s configuration. They can perform site-wide bans of users who violate Terms of Service, which prevents those users from logging in or creating content anywhere on the platform. Admins can also create or remove subreddits (for instance, removing a subreddit that is inactive or violates policy). They likely have access to an admin dashboard with user management tools (search users, reset passwords or handle abuse reports, etc.), and site analytics (overall traffic, growth metrics). Administrators will also oversee moderator actions to some extent – e.g. they can demote a moderator if needed or intervene in communities that go rogue (akin to how Reddit admins step in for rule violations or emergencies
en.wikipedia.org
). Additionally, admins handle any global settings such as feature flags, the site-wide announcement bar, ad management (if applicable), and so on. Limitations: Admins should exercise their powers carefully to maintain community trust. While technically unlimited, we will internally restrict admin actions to a few trusted team members. Also, admins will follow content policies – e.g. they wouldn’t remove content just for being controversial unless it breaks rules. In terms of UI, admin features will mostly live in a back-office interface not exposed to normal users. Expected Usage Patterns: Initially, the founding team (developers/product team) will act as admins. They will use admin privileges to moderate early content, assist users, and configure the system. As the platform grows, we may assign dedicated community managers or trust & safety personnel as admins. They will handle user reports that escalate beyond mods (for example, harassment that spans multiple communities or spam network attacks). We expect administrators to also help seed and maintain the culture and rules of the platform. For example, they may create official guidelines posts, run site-wide events (like an “Ask Me Anything” event), or mediate disputes between moderators if needed. Overall, admins are the guardians of the platform ensuring it runs smoothly and aligns with the vision. The existence of admins will be transparent – possibly indicated by a label on their username (like Reddit’s “admin” badge) when they post, so users know when an official admin is speaking with authority.
Content Creators (High-Engagement Users): This persona refers to users who contribute a large volume of content or high-quality content that draws lots of engagement. They may or may not have any formal additional privileges, but we treat them as a distinct group to support and incentivize. Permissions & Capabilities: Content creators are essentially power users of the registered user group. They have all the same capabilities as registered users (posting, commenting, voting, etc.), but often at a higher frequency or quality. They might create their own subreddits focused on their personal content (for example, an enthusiast who posts daily tutorials could have their own community or be a notable contributor in a larger community). We may implement special recognition for these users: for instance, verified users or those with high reputation might get badges, higher rate limits, or access to beta features. In terms of direct permissions, at MVP they don’t have more powers than a regular user, but product-wise we want to cater to their needs (for example, better content management tools, analytics about their posts’ performance, etc. could be offered later). Limitations: Unless they become moderators or admins, content creators are bound by the same rules as others. One limitation is they might hit content rate limits – if someone is extremely active, we need to ensure our platform can handle that and not mistake it for spam (we might implement a graduated karma system: new users have low limits, established creators have higher limits on posts per day, etc.). Expected Usage Patterns: We expect a small percentage of users to account for a large share of posts/comments (again referencing the 1% rule where ~1% of users might generate the majority of content
nngroup.com
). These heavy contributors (bloggers, experts, meme-makers, etc.) are key to keeping communities vibrant. They likely log in daily, post often, respond to comments on their posts, and accumulate followers/karma. We plan features to reward and retain these users: e.g. karma points for upvotes, leaderboards highlighting top contributors in a community, possibly a “Content Creator” program down the line where we could offer perks (like profile customization, or even monetization opportunities if we implement tipping or revenue sharing). Initially, recognition (karma, badges) and direct engagement (the team highlighting their great posts in official channels) will be used to encourage them. It’s crucial we listen to their feedback as they will stress-test our posting tools and moderation. In sum, content creators are our “influencers” – we have no platform without them – so while they don’t get special moderation power, they get our special attention for feature development.
Lurkers (Read-Only Participants): Lurkers are users who consume content but rarely or never contribute. This category overlaps with anonymous visitors but also includes logged-in users who don’t post. For example, a user might create an account to customize their feed via subscriptions, but then primarily lurk (vote occasionally but not post). Permissions & Capabilities: Lurkers have whatever permissions their account status grants (anonymous lurkers have guest permissions; logged-in lurkers have member permissions). The key distinction is their behavior: they mostly read and vote, and their contributions are minimal. Limitations: There are no additional platform-imposed limitations specifically on lurkers – the limitation is self-imposed (lack of contribution). However, the community dynamics often treat lurkers as “the silent majority” with little influence on discussion except through voting. Our system might impose slight restrictions that indirectly affect lurkers: for instance, some communities might require a user to have a certain karma or tenure to do specific things (which lurkers wouldn’t have if they never post). But generally, lurkers are free to remain invisible participants. Usage Patterns: We expect lurkers to be the largest user group by far – possibly 90% of users, consistent with known participation inequality in online communities
nngroup.com
. They log in (or remain logged out) and scroll through content, enjoying the discussions and information but not adding their own. They may vote on content that resonates (or just passively consume). They might also share content externally (copying links to interesting posts). Lurkers derive value from the community without directly giving back content – which is fine as they add to traffic and can convert to active users over time. Our goal is to gradually convert lurkers into contributors: strategies include making the onboarding to posting easy, creating low-barrier ways to participate (polls, upvotes, simple Q&A prompts) so that lurkers might take a small action. We also consider that lurkers often have high-quality contributions that they could share but haven’t (possibly due to shyness or not feeling incentivized). So, features like anonymous posting or encouraging questions can help bring lurkers out. It’s important to design the UX so that lurkers at least feel engaged: e.g. show them personalized recommendations, let them save/bookmark content, etc., which gives them a sense of involvement beyond posting. In analytics terms, we will track monthly active lurkers vs contributors to see if our engagement strategies are working – ideally, we’d like to increase the 10% who contribute to maybe 15-20% over time, narrowing the gap in the 90-9-1 rule (some recent community studies suggest with right design, one can improve the ratio
communitybuilding.stackexchange.com

).

In summary, our user roles span from casual readers to power moderators. Each role is considered in our feature design:
Anonymous visitors get a full browsing experience to hook their interest.
Registered users are empowered to post, vote, and create communities – they are the standard participants.
Moderators volunteer to keep communities healthy and have tools to manage content in their domains.
Administrators oversee the entire platform to enforce global policies and support the community.
Content creators are our high-engagement users whom we will incentivize and maybe give special recognition, as their contributions drive the platform.
Lurkers constitute the majority who quietly consume content; we will accommodate them and gently encourage more active participation.
Understanding these personas ensures that we design permissions and features appropriate to each, fostering a safe and engaging environment. For example, the posting UI will be very visible to registered users to encourage contributions, whereas for anonymous users we might emphasize trending content to keep them browsing. Moderation interfaces will be built to be straightforward so moderators can easily uphold community standards
en.wikipedia.org
. Admin tools will be kept separate to avoid misuse and will be used sparingly to maintain a balance between community autonomy and overall order. By clearly defining these roles, we can also shape our community culture and growth strategies (detailed in the Charter section) – for instance, targeting tech-savvy lurkers to convert them into content creators by highlighting niche discussions that need their input.

Feature Definition and Milestones
We have planned an extensive list of features, organized into milestones that represent sequential, deployable increments. Each milestone delivers a set of cohesive features that provide user value on their own, while building toward the full vision of the platform. We outline 5 major milestones (M1 through M5), each comprising multiple features. For each feature, we detail its functional requirements, acceptance criteria, technical notes, dependencies, complexity, and success metrics. This staged approach ensures that at the end of each milestone, we have a working application we can potentially release or beta test, aligning with our strategy of iterative releases and early user feedback.
Milestone 1: Foundational MVP – Core Posting and Browsing
Objective: Establish the core Reddit-like functionality so that users can browse content and contribute basic posts and comments. This milestone focuses on a single-community prototype (or very few communities) to prove out posting, commenting, voting, and basic user accounts. Features in M1:
User Registration & Login (Basic Auth): Requirements: Users can create an account (username, email, password) and log in/out. Password reset via email is included. Acceptance Criteria: A new user can sign up with a unique username and valid email, verify their email (if required), and then login to access member features. Logging out should end the session. Technical Notes: Implemented via NextAuth (credentials provider initially). Use Zod to validate username (allowed chars, length) and strong password rules. Dependencies: Email service (for verification or password reset), database for storing user credentials. Complexity: Moderate – involves forms, DB writes, and integration with email. Success Metrics: Sign-up conversion rate (percentage of visitors who register), and no. of new registrations in first week. Functional Notes: Ensure proper error messages (username taken, weak password). Also set up a rate-limit on registration attempts to prevent abuse.
Create Post (Text Post): Requirements: Logged-in users can create a text-based post in a default community (in M1, perhaps we have a single general community). Post has a title (required) and body (optional). Acceptance Criteria: After submission, the new post appears at the top of the feed (if sorting by new) or appropriate position. Other users can view the post’s page. Technical Notes: Use a form with Title (max length e.g. 300 chars) and Body (multi-line). Save to DB with a unique ID, timestamp, author reference. Possibly slugify title for URL (but can also use ID). Dependencies: User must be logged in (depends on auth). DB schema for posts must be ready. Complexity: Low – single insert, but must handle errors (e.g. title empty). Success Metrics: Number of posts created per day; post submission success rate (no. of attempts vs. successes, to catch validation issues). Acceptance Tests: If user tries to submit empty title, they get error and cannot proceed (client-side and server-side validation). A valid post leads to a page refresh or dynamic update showing their post.
View Feed/Homepage: Requirements: Users (logged in or not) can see a list of posts on the homepage. In M1 this might just show all posts (since only one or few communities). Support sorting by New (chronological) and perhaps Top (by votes) for context. Acceptance Criteria: Visiting “/” shows a feed of posts with their title, score, author, timestamp, and comment count. As posts are added, feed updates (upon refresh or via client fetch). Technical Notes: Implement as a Next.js page that fetches posts from API or does server-side render. For M1, we can sort by creation time for New, and if Top sorting is included, sort by vote count (with ties by time). Use pagination or infinite scroll if posts > N. Dependencies: Post creation (above). Complexity: Low – listing items from DB. Success Metrics: Page load time for feed; bounce rate of homepage. Additional: This is crucial for first impression; ensure layout is clean and loads quickly. We might show a dummy message if no posts exist (“Be the first to post!”).
Post Detail Page: Requirements: Clicking on a post shows its detail page, including the post content and comments thread. Acceptance Criteria: The URL /posts/[id] (or similar) loads the post’s title, body, author, timestamp, and the comments section. Technical Notes: Next.js dynamic route for post ID. Fetch the post by ID (and associated comments, see below). Render markup; if body has formatting (M1 can keep plain text or basic markdown). Dependencies: Post creation. Complexity: Low. Success Metrics: Time spent on post pages (indicator of engagement).
Comment on Post: Requirements: Logged-in users can comment under a post. Comments may be nested (replies to replies). Acceptance Criteria: On a post page, a logged-in user sees a comment input box. Submitting a comment adds it to the thread in the correct position. Comments show author, timestamp, and can be upvoted. Technical Notes: Comments DB table with fields: id, postId, parentCommentId (null for top-level), authorId, text, timestamp, score. For M1, we can allow one level nesting or multi-level. Ideally multi-level (as Reddit does) – we can implement recursion or limit depth initially. Use optimistic UI update or refresh after submission. Dependencies: Auth (only members comment), Post detail page. Complexity: Moderate – involves tree structure if nested, and ensuring UI indenting, etc. Success Metrics: Number of comments per post; average comments per post (should grow as engagement increases). Acceptance Tests: A user can comment, then see their comment immediately appear. If they refresh, the comment persists (in DB). Posting an empty comment should be prevented (validation).
Voting on Posts and Comments: Requirements: Users can upvote or downvote content (posts and comments). The score is displayed and updates. Acceptance Criteria: Next to each post and comment, logged-in users see upvote/downvote buttons. Clicking upvote increments the score (and perhaps highlights the arrow to indicate user’s choice). Downvote decrements it. Users can undo or switch their vote. Guests clicking vote should be prompted to login. Technical Notes: Voting table to track userId -> (postId or commentId) with vote value (+1 or -1). Or store vote counts on the post/comment and adjust counts transactionally (but need to prevent double voting – so tracking user votes is necessary). Implement via an API route e.g. POST /api/vote that takes {postId, value} or {commentId, value}. Dependencies: Auth (for tracking user vote), and posts/comments existing. Complexity: Moderate – concurrency and consistency matters (ensuring a user can’t vote twice). Use database constraints or upsert logic. Success Metrics: Ratio of posts with at least one vote; average upvotes per post (over time). Acceptance Tests: If a user upvotes a post, the score goes from X to X+1 and their upvote button is highlighted. Clicking upvote again (to “unvote”) brings it back to X. Clicking downvote after upvote changes score to X-1 (essentially X - 2 from original) and toggles highlights accordingly. Guest users clicking should trigger a sign-in modal.
Basic Subreddit (Community) Pages: Requirements: Even in M1, we define the concept of a community (subreddit). Perhaps we start with a default one (e.g. r/general or r/all) and allow viewing posts filtered by community. Acceptance Criteria: A page like /r/[communityName] shows posts only from that community. The community has a description and can list moderators. For M1, since we may not have community creation yet, we can pre-create one or two communities and allow navigation. Technical Notes: Community table in DB (id, name, description, creatorId, createdAt). Each post links to a community (post has communityId). The Feed page could initially be identical to r/all (aggregating all communities) or just point to one community if only one exists. Dependencies: Posts (to filter by community), and if we allow creation, then need that feature (but likely community creation will be Milestone 2). Complexity: Low – filtering logic. Success Metrics: N/A in M1 specifically (but eventually number of communities and distribution of posts across them). Acceptance Criteria: Visiting the community page clearly indicates the community name and shows relevant posts. If community doesn’t exist, show 404 or a prompt to create (if creation is open).
Milestone 1 Summary: By the end of M1 (estimated ~1 month), we have a minimal Reddit clone: Users can sign up, log in, create text posts, comment on them, and vote. All content is public and in (a) default community(ies). There is a basic feed and individual post pages. This MVP is deployable – we could launch a small closed beta to gather initial feedback on usability, core mechanics, and obvious bugs. Key success metrics for M1 would be successful user registrations, number of posts and comments created, and basic engagement like votes. If these numbers are low, we iterate on usability (is posting too hidden? is login easy enough?). Acceptance tests and QA will ensure these fundamentals work reliably because all later features build on this core.

Milestone 2: Community Building and Moderation Tools
Objective: Expand the platform to support multiple subreddits and give users and moderators tools to manage communities. This milestone introduces subreddit creation and subscription, and basic moderation capabilities like content removal and user bans. It also adds search and discovery features to help users find communities and content. Features in M2:
Create Subreddit (Community Creation): Requirements: Users can create a new subreddit by specifying a unique name and perhaps a description. They become the moderator of that subreddit. Acceptance Criteria: A logged-in user goes to a “Create Community” form, enters a name (that isn’t already taken, say 3-21 characters, only alphanumeric and underscores), and a brief description. Upon creation, the site generates the new subreddit page (e.g. /r/MyTopic) and lists the user as moderator. Technical Notes: Ensure name uniqueness at DB level (unique index). Possibly reserve certain names. Use slug normalization to avoid confusion (e.g. case-insensitivity). Dependencies: Auth. Also need the subreddit browsing page implemented (from M1). Complexity: Low-Moderate – need to handle potential name conflicts and future scaling (we might eventually allow millions of communities, but for MVP, the volume is small). Success Metrics: Number of communities created; ratio of active communities (with posts) to created communities. Acceptance Tests: Trying to create a community with a name that’s taken yields an error “name already exists”. Creating with valid input redirects the user to the new community page which they now “own” and can start posting in.
Subreddit Subscription & User Feeds: Requirements: Users can subscribe to communities they like. The home feed (for logged-in users) then shows posts from their subscriptions (not all posts). They can manage their subscriptions (subscribe/unsubscribe on community pages, and a list somewhere in profile). Acceptance Criteria: On a community page (/r/XYZ), a logged-in user sees a “Subscribe” button (if not already subscribed). Clicking it adds the community to their subscriptions and changes to “Subscribed” (or “Unsubscribe” for toggling). The user’s homepage (or a personalized feed page) will aggregate posts only from their subscribed communities. New users by default might be auto-subscribed to some popular communities or none (TBD). Technical Notes: Subscription table (userId, subredditId). When rendering the home feed for a user, query posts where community in user’s subs list (or join). For guest users, home can either show top posts overall (like Reddit’s popular/all) or prompt to login for a personalized experience. We also need a UI for managing subs – possibly in the user’s profile or a separate “My Communities” page listing all subs with an unsubscribe option. Dependencies: Community and posts features. Complexity: Moderate – must ensure feed queries are efficient (use index on post.communityId and a list of subscribed IDs – manageable with small numbers, might need optimization for many subs). Success Metrics: Average number of subscriptions per active user (higher indicates users are finding and following communities). Also retention might increase when feed is personalized. Acceptance Tests: If user A subscribes to “Sports” and “Tech” communities, their feed should show only posts from those two communities. If they unsubscribe from “Tech”, new tech posts no longer show up. Ensure unsubscribing doesn’t delete the community or user’s posts in it, just stops showing on feed.
Community Info and Moderation Settings: Requirements: Each subreddit has an info sidebar (with description, rules, moderator list) and moderators have a settings page to edit the community. Moderators can set community description, rules, and possibly toggle settings like whether the community is public or restricted (M2 might just do public). Acceptance Criteria: On /r/XYZ, there is a visible description/rules section (especially on desktop, could be a sidebar; on mobile, maybe a section at top or a link to info). If the logged-in user is a moderator of that community, they see an “Edit Community” or “Moderation Tools” button. In that modal/page, they can change the description text, add a list of rules, and see the current moderators list (maybe add mods by entering username in M3 or M4). Save changes updates the community info on the page. Technical Notes: Extend Community model to have fields: description (text), rules (perhaps as markdown or an array of rules with titles). Moderator list from a separate table (Moderators table mapping userId and subredditId with a role). Initially, the creator is inserted as mod. Moderation UI can be a simple form. Dependencies: Community creation to identify mods. Auth (only allow mods to edit). Complexity: Low. Success Metrics: Not directly user-facing metric, but can consider number of communities that have customized their descriptions (indicating mod engagement). Acceptance Tests: A moderator changes the description and saves; the new description is immediately shown on community page. Non-mod users see the updated description. Unauthorized users cannot see the edit controls.
Post Flair / Tag (optional if time): Requirements: (If included) Mods can define a set of tags (flairs) for their community and users can tag their posts with one. This helps categorize posts. Acceptance Criteria: E.g., in a programming subreddit, flairs like “Question”, “Tutorial”, “Discussion” can be set. When posting, user chooses a flair. The post displays the flair next to title. Technical Notes: Flair table (id, subredditId, label, color). UI in mod settings to create/delete flairs. Field in Post for flairId. Dependencies: Not critical, can be deferred if time. Complexity: Moderate (mostly UI complexity in creation and selection). We might skip this in M2 depending on priorities.
Content Moderation: Remove Post/Comment: Requirements: Community moderators can remove (take down) posts or comments in their subreddit. Removed content might be marked as “[removed]” in UI but retained in DB (for possible admin review). Acceptance Criteria: If a moderator clicks “Remove” on a post or comment, that item is immediately hidden from normal view in that subreddit (and ideally from feeds). Other users see “This post has been removed by the moderators” on the post page (for transparency). Moderators (and admins) might still see it with a label that it's removed (in case they need to review). Technical Notes: Add a status flag to posts/comments (e.g. isRemoved, or a status enum). The remove action is an update to set that flag. UI: For mods, each post/comment could have a small “remove” button. Possibly, a confirmation dialog for safety. We should also implement report functionality by users: e.g. a user can report a post to mods, which would queue it – however, if short on time we might implement report in M3. For M2, mods can proactively remove anything. We will ensure removed content doesn’t show up in regular queries (e.g. feed query filters out removed posts unless viewer is mod of that community or admin). Dependencies: Auth & mod identification, posts/comments exist. Complexity: Low. Success Metrics: Number of removed items (initially likely low). We will track if moderation tools are used, which indicates moderation activity and health of communities. Acceptance Tests: A mod removes a post: it disappears from the community feed and home feeds. If a normal user goes to the post URL, they see a “removed” notice but not the content. If the mod or an admin views it (maybe via a special mod view), they can still see it if needed (optional for M2 to implement mod view). Removing a comment should similarly hide the text and perhaps collapse it with “[removed]” label.
User Bans (Community Level): Requirements: Moderators can ban a user from their subreddit, preventing that user from posting or commenting in that community. Acceptance Criteria: In a mod interface (possibly on a user’s profile or via a mod tool next to their post/comment), a mod selects “Ban user” for that community. After banning, that user’s posts/comments in the community are automatically removed or at least future ones blocked. The banned user should receive an error or notice if they attempt to post/comment in that community (“You have been banned from r/XYZ”). Technical Notes: Create a Ban table (userId, subredditId, banDate, reason optional). When a user tries to create content, check against this table. Also, in the community page, if the user is banned we could hide the post/comment form. Mods might optionally specify a reason or duration, but MVP can just do indefinite bans without UI for reason. Dependencies: Auth, moderation rights. Complexity: Moderate – mostly need to ensure we check bans in the right places (posting/commenting endpoints). Success Metrics: Not something we want a lot of ideally, but if used, shows mods are policing. We can track number of bans enacted. Acceptance Tests: A banned user cannot make new posts or comments in that community (tested by trying via UI or API). If unbanned (we might not implement UI for unban yet, but in DB can remove entry), then they can again. Mods should see the list of banned users somewhere (maybe M3 feature to list/manage bans).
Basic Search (Posts/Communities): Requirements: Implement a basic search bar to find posts or communities by keyword. At least allow community name search to help users find and join communities. Acceptance Criteria: A search input is available (e.g. in navbar). If a user enters a query and submits, they get a search results page. For M2, we can keep it simple: search through community names and post titles (and maybe post bodies) for matches. Results show matching communities (with option to subscribe) and matching posts (with link to them). Technical Notes: Implement a search API that does SQL queries with WHERE title ILIKE %query% or using Postgres full-text search. Scale is low so a straightforward approach is fine. Consider indexing text fields for speed. Dependencies: Posts and communities existing. Complexity: Moderate – building the UI and combining results. Could split tabs: “Communities” vs “Posts” results. But maybe a unified list with labels is enough for MVP. Success Metrics: Searches per user, conversion from search to join (if they search and then subscribe to a found community, that’s a good outcome). Acceptance Tests: Searching “foo” should return any community named “foo” or with description containing it, and posts with “foo” in title or content. If nothing, show “no results”. Ensure search works for partial matches (depending on implementation, might need trigram search or at least case-insensitivity).
Navigation & Discovery Improvements: Requirements: Add elements to facilitate discovery: e.g., a list of popular communities, trending posts, etc., to help new users explore. Acceptance Criteria: Perhaps on the frontpage or a sidebar, we list top 5 communities by subscriber count or trending today. Also, maybe a “Trending posts” section that shows high-vote posts in the last 24h. Technical Notes: Compute basic metrics: community subscriber count (just length of subscription list), community post frequency, etc. For trending, query posts from last day/week sorted by score or comment count. Implement as simple components or static queries updated periodically. Dependencies: Subscriptions, posts, votes in place. Complexity: Low. Success Metrics: Engagement with discovery components (like how many clicks on suggested communities, etc.). Acceptance Tests: The “Popular Communities” list actually reflects what’s in DB (e.g., if one community has 50 subs and others have 10, it appears first). If a new user visits, they see that list and can click to view or subscribe.
Milestone 2 ends with the platform supporting multiple communities and basic moderation. Now users can join niche communities, and moderators have essential tools to cultivate them. We also added search and discovery to navigate the growing content. After M2 (around month 2), we expect to open the platform to more users because it now embodies more of Reddit’s core structure (subreddits). We’ll measure success by growth in communities and user retention (since personalization via subscriptions should increase retention). Milestone 2 features will be validated by checking: can a community form and self-moderate with minimal admin intervention? Are users able to find content relevant to them? For example, success would be having at least e.g. 50 communities created organically and active discussions in several of them, indicating that the multi-community architecture is working.

Milestone 3: Enhanced Engagement and Interaction
Objective: Build features that deepen user engagement and make the platform more interactive. This includes notifications, direct messaging or chat, richer content support (images/videos in posts), and enhancements to existing systems (like user profiles with activity, and additional mod tools like mod mail or automoderation basics). Also, start introducing performance optimizations as needed once engagement increases (like infinite scroll for feeds). Features in M3:
Notifications System: Requirements: Users receive notifications for important events: when someone replies to their comment or post, when they are mentioned by username, when they get a direct message, or when a post they follow gets new comments (if subscribed to threads). Possibly also notifications for mod actions (if they are a mod and someone posts in their community, or a user reports something). Acceptance Criteria: A notification bell icon in the header shows a count of unread notifications. Clicking it shows a dropdown or page listing recent notifications (e.g., “UserX replied to your comment in r/YZ”, “You have been mentioned in r/ABC”, etc.). Users can mark notifications as read. Real-time push (if using websockets or polling) would be nice, but MVP can update when page loads or on interval. Technical Notes: Create a Notification table with userId, type, context (like post/comment id), message, createdAt, read flag. When events happen (comment posted, etc.), create notifications for relevant users. Possibly integrate with a WebSocket or SSE to push new notifs to client in real-time (if not now, maybe M4). Ensure notifs aren’t duplicated (e.g. if someone replies and mentions the user, that’s one event or two? Possibly combine logic). Dependencies: The events themselves (posting, commenting, mentions) must provide hooks. Complexity: Moderate-high – needs backend logic for each event and front-end UI+state for notifications. Success Metrics: Notification open rate (do users click their notifications), and does this bring them back (retention metric). Acceptance Tests: When user B replies to user A, user A sees a new notification within a short time, containing link to that reply. If user A clicks it, they are taken to the comment and the notification is marked read. If user A has no notifications, the UI indicates zero. Edge: Ensure notifications are only delivered to relevant users (no spammy or wrong notifications).
Direct Messaging between Users: Requirements: Users can send private messages to each other (1:1 chats). This fosters personal connections and off-topic discussions. Acceptance Criteria: A user can visit another’s profile and click “Send Message”, or from a messages section, compose a new message to a username. The recipient receives it in their inbox (this also ties into notifications). Conversations are threaded by user pairs. Basic text messaging suffices for MVP (no rich media in DMs at first). Technical Notes: We can implement a simple “Messages” table (id, senderId, recipientId, body, timestamp, read). Or use a conversation approach if we see it as chat – but simpler: just treat it like emails. Provide a UI in a “Messages” page listing conversations or messages. Possibly integrate an existing solution (but likely custom is fine). Dependencies: Auth, obviously. Complexity: Moderate – not terribly complex but requires building a messaging UI and making sure it’s secure (only the two users can see it). We should also have a way to block users if harassment occurs (maybe M4 feature). Success Metrics: Number of messages sent, and quality anecdotal feedback if it’s used for meaningful interactions. Acceptance Tests: User A sends message to B with subject/body (if we have subject) or just body. User B when logs in sees an alert or goes to messages and reads it. They can reply, and then user A can see reply. If user tries to message nonexistent user, they get error. Security: ensure you cannot access others’ messages via ID manipulation.
User Profiles and History: Requirements: Expand user profiles to show more than just name. Include their karma points (if we implement scoring), their recent posts and comments, and possibly trophies or badges. Profiles allow others to follow their activity (though we may not have a follow feature yet, but they can check manual). Acceptance Criteria: Clicking a username opens a profile page: e.g. /user/username. It shows their avatar, bio, join date, and statistics (like number of posts, comment karma, etc.). Below, a list of their recent posts and comments (with links). If the profile is of the logged-in user, also show an edit button to change bio/avatar, etc. Technical Notes: Already have user table with some info, just extending. Compute karma = sum of votes on their posts and comments (we can maintain a counter or compute on the fly). Possibly a separate table for trophy/badges which we can fill later. Profile should paginate their contributions. For privacy, all contributions are public by default (like Reddit) – we could allow user to mark profile private in future. Dependencies: Posts, comments, votes data. Complexity: Low to moderate (just displaying data nicely). Success Metrics: How often are profiles viewed (indicator: people interested in who’s who). Acceptance Tests: Viewing one’s own profile shows correct counts (we can verify by DB queries). Changing bio updates properly. Another user’s profile doesn’t show private info (like email) – only public info.
Rich Media in Posts: Requirements: Allow posts to include images (and possibly videos or links). This would make the platform closer to Reddit’s variety (text, image, video, link posts). For M3, perhaps implement image upload and link posts. Acceptance Criteria: When creating a post, user can choose type: Text, Image, or Link.
Image post: user uploads an image (from device) and can add an optional caption text. The post in feed shows a thumbnail or the image itself. Clicking opens full image.
Link post: user provides a URL and a title; the post shows a preview or at least the link and possibly fetches metadata (like title/thumbnail) to display.
Technical Notes: Need an image storage solution. Options: integrate an S3 bucket or use a service like Cloudinary. We can store the image file in an S3 and save the URL in the post record. We’ll restrict file types (jpg/png/gif) and size (maybe <5MB at first). For videos, might skip for now or handle via external links (like embed YouTube). For link posts, use OpenGraph meta tags scraping: we can fetch the link in backend and get title/description for preview or use an API. Or simpler, just display the URL and allow click-out. Dependencies: Some infrastructure for file storage. If not available, a hack could be encoding images as base64 in DB, but that’s not scalable. Likely we set up an S3 (or even Imgur API if quick and dirty for MVP). Complexity: High for image (handling upload flows, storage, security). Medium for link scraping. Success Metrics: Adoption of image/link posts (percentage of posts that are media vs text). Acceptance Tests: Image upload: user selects a file, the upload completes, and the new post displays the image. Another user sees that image. The file is accessible (with correct permissions). Link post: user enters a URL, the post displays maybe the site’s favicon or a snippet if implemented, and clicking it opens the external site in new tab. All posts (text/image/link) coexist in feed.
Comment and Post Editing: Requirements: Users can edit their own posts and comments after publishing (with an edit history or at least a marker “edited”). Acceptance Criteria: A user sees an “Edit” option on their own post/comment. Clicking it turns the content into an editable textarea (or opens a modal), they change text, save. The content updates in place with a small “(edited)” label. If the post was removed or locked, editing might be disabled (but that’s advanced, skip for now). Technical Notes: Allow updates on posts and comments tables for content fields. Possibly keep a editedAt timestamp. No need to store full history for MVP, just mark it edited. Ensure that editing a post does not bump it in feed or change vote counts etc. Comments likewise. Dependencies: Base posting and commenting done. Complexity: Low. Success Metrics: N/A specifically, but qualitatively reduces user frustration (typo corrections, etc.). Acceptance Tests: Edit a comment, see the new text and “edited” label. Another user refreshing sees the updated text.
Infinite Scroll / Pagination Improvements: Requirements: As content grows, implement better loading for feeds and comments. Possibly infinite scroll on the main feed and auto-loading of more comments when needed. Acceptance Criteria: On the homepage or community page, as the user scrolls near bottom, next batch of posts loads and appends, instead of a traditional pagination. Similarly, for comments if a post has hundreds, maybe load top N by default and a “load more comments” button or infinite scroll in comments. Technical Notes: Use React Query or similar to fetch with page param or cursor (like post ID or time). Maintain a state of loaded pages. For comments, could load lazily nested replies (like Reddit collapses threads – clicking “view more replies” loads them). Dependencies: Need enough content to justify this – by M3 we might have it. Complexity: Moderate – but solvable with existing patterns (TanStack Query supports infinite). Success Metrics: Lower bounce due to quicker content discovery (maybe pages per session increases if scroll is smooth). Acceptance Tests: When 50 posts loaded and user scrolls beyond, ensure another set loads without full refresh. No duplicate or missing items. Performance stays acceptable (not too janky on load).
Improved Moderation Tools (Mod Queue, Reports): Requirements: Introduce a mod queue where reported content appears for moderators to review. Allow users to report posts/comments, which then show up for mods. Possibly add mod notes or a simple automoderation tool (like filters). Acceptance Criteria: A user can click “Report” on a post/comment, choose a reason (we can provide a few categories or a text box). This creates a report entry. Moderators of that community (and admins) have a “Moderation Queue” page listing all reports in their communities. There they can see each reported item and take action (remove, ignore). Technical Notes: Reports table: id, itemType, itemId, reporterId, reason, status. The mod queue page queries all open reports for communities the mod moderates. Could filter by community if they mod multiple. Provide “mark as addressed” or tie addressing to removal (if mod removes a reported post, mark the report resolved). Automoderation (optional): allow mods to add a list of banned keywords; any new post/comment containing them could auto-report or auto-remove. If simple to do, we can include a basic version. Dependencies: Moderation and content items existing. Complexity: Moderate – building UI and flows for report handling. Success Metrics: Number of reports handled, and reduced response time to remove offending content. Acceptance Tests: User A reports a comment. Mod (User B) goes to mod queue and sees it listed with reason. Mod clicks remove, the comment is removed and the report is marked resolved (no longer shows in queue). If mod clicks ignore, report marked closed but content stays. Ensure only relevant mods see the report (shouldn’t see reports from communities they don’t moderate).
With Milestone 3 (around month 3), the platform becomes much more feature-rich and sticky. Users are now getting notifications to pull them back in, can have side conversations via messaging, and enjoy richer content formats. Moderators have better oversight with reporting. These features should significantly improve user engagement: notifications and messages increase daily visits (people come back to check replies or chat), images and links broaden content appeal (not just walls of text), and profile stats/karma tap into competitive/social drive. We should observe metrics like DAU/MAU (stickiness) increase due to notifications (users logging in more frequently to check updates). Also average session length might go up thanks to infinite scroll and richer media. At this stage, we likely move from a small beta to a more open beta or even general availability if core usage is solid, because the platform by now covers most key capabilities of a Reddit-like system.

Milestone 4: Scaling, Performance & Advanced Features
Objective: Prepare the platform for larger scale and implement advanced features that set us apart. Focus on scalability optimizations, security enhancements, and some unique differentiators. Also possibly introduce mobile app or PWA improvements and further community tools (polls, wiki, events). This milestone may extend beyond the initial 3-4 month MVP window, serving as a transition from MVP to a more mature product. Features in M4:
Performance Optimization & Caching: Tasks: Identify slow points (via monitoring) and implement caching or optimizations. For example, introduce Redis caching for expensive queries like top posts feed or search results. Implement database query optimizations (adding indexes or denormalizing counts). Possibly introduce content delivery optimizations (using a CDN for images, optimizing bundle splitting further). Success Criteria: Page load times under target (e.g. <1s for main feed content after initial). The app should handle X concurrent users without timeouts. Notes: This is a broad effort rather than a single feature. Will be guided by metrics collected. Possibly implement server-side rendering caching for pages with heavy content (like static generation for community pages that update every minute). Also optimize WebSocket usage if introduced (ensuring not too many open conns). Complexity: High – requires careful work but is mostly internal changes. Metrics: Lower server response times, lower database load per request (monitored via slow query logs).
PWA and Mobile Optimization: Requirements: Make sure the web app is mobile-friendly and perhaps add PWA (Progressive Web App) capabilities so users can "install" it on mobile home screens. Possibly create a minimal Android/iOS wrapper if needed (or delay native apps to post-M4). Acceptance Criteria: On mobile, the site is fully responsive (Tailwind helps here). The PWA manifest is in place and Chrome can install the app, which then loads offline shell and caches assets. Notes: Already likely designing responsive from start with Tailwind. PWA: need manifest.json, service worker for offline caching (maybe using Next.js PWA plugin). Complexity: Low-medium. Success Metrics: % of mobile users who add to home screen, mobile bounce rate improvements.
Full-Text Search & Advanced Filters: Requirements: Upgrade search to be more robust, possibly using an external search service (ElasticSearch or Algolia) for better relevance, typo-tolerance, and filtering by author, community, etc. Acceptance Criteria: A user can search with advanced queries (e.g. “author:someuser keyword” or filter by community easily). Results are more accurate and can be sorted by relevance or date. Notes: This likely requires syncing data to a search index. If using Algolia, integrate their API and update records on new posts/comments. Or self-host an Elastic cluster if feasible. Complexity: High (external integration and maintenance). Metrics: Search usage and success (like if user doesn’t rephrase queries too much, indicating they found what they needed).
Advanced Community Features: Potential sub-features:
Moderation Log: A log page listing all actions taken by mods (who removed what, who banned whom, etc.) for transparency and coordination. Acceptance: Mods can see a chronological list of mod actions in their community.
Automated Moderator Bots/Rules: Provide built-in options like “Automatically remove posts with more than 3 reports” or “Auto-remove if user’s account age < 1 day and contains a link”. Might be complex to implement fully, maybe allow simple settings in UI.
Community Wiki/Pages: Each community can have a wiki or static pages (like FAQ) mod-editable. Possibly too large for now; if time allows implement a simple pinned “Wiki” post or about page.
Scheduled Posts/Events: Tools for mods to schedule daily threads or events (could leverage a cron and template posts).
Complexity: Each is moderate to high. We would prioritize what’s most needed by early communities. Possibly the moderation log (for transparency) and a basic wiki (for communal info) are valuable. If unique differentiator, maybe an AMA (Ask Me Anything) format feature or polls integrated.
Security and Compliance Features: Tasks: Strengthen security: implement 2FA for logins as optional, implement content filters to detect spam or malicious links (maybe integration with third-party spam detection). Ensure GDPR compliance: allow users to download their data, delete account fully. Also implement rate limiting on APIs globally to prevent abuse (login brute force, posting spam – e.g. max posts per 5 minutes globally and per IP). Notes: This is part feature, part operational. We likely integrate a library for 2FA (TOTP apps or SMS using a service like Twilio if needed). Account deletion flow to remove personal data. Complexity: Moderate to high depending on scope. But necessary as we scale beyond MVP to ensure safety and compliance.
Unique Differentiator Features: (This overlaps with “Innovative user-facing features” section below, but by milestone planning, some would be implemented around M4.)
Example: Personalized Feed with ML – algorithmic recommendations mixing content from outside your subscriptions that you might like. If we want to outperform Reddit on discovery, we can add a “Recommended for you” section using a basic recommendation algorithm (e.g., if user is active in r/sports and r/fitness, maybe show them popular posts from r/health).
Another: Better Threaded Discussions – maybe a feature to sort comments by different criteria (most insightful via some metric or allow users to endorse good comments).
Gamification: Introduce badges for hitting milestones (first 100 upvotes, etc.), and show these on profiles. Also a weekly leaderboard of top contributors per community or site-wide, to drive competition.
Complexity: Possibly high if ML is involved, but can start simple with heuristic recommendations. Gamification is moderate (just tracking stats and awarding badges).
Milestone 4, likely beyond month 4 into month 5-6, is about hardening and differentiating. The platform by this point can handle a larger user base and has more polish and features than a basic clone, hopefully giving users reasons to prefer it. We would measure success here by scaling metrics: system should handle say 10x more users than in M3 without degradation. Also user satisfaction via surveys on new features (do they like the new feed algorithm, etc.).

Milestone 5: Monetization and Growth
(This milestone may run in parallel or after initial launch, focusing on business viability and explosive growth strategies.)
Monetization Features: Possible tasks: Introduce advertising (promoted posts in feed, with clear labeling), and/or a Premium membership (like Reddit Gold/Premium) where users can pay a subscription to get extra perks (no ads, special avatar, profile customization, etc.). Also consider creator monetization: letting content creators receive tips or have Patreon-like support inside platform. Acceptance Criteria: If ads: some posts in feed are marked “Sponsored” and come from an ad system (initially can be manually inserted or use a simple ad server). If premium: Users can upgrade via payment (integrate Stripe) to get perks (like a badge, no ads). Complexity: High, involves financial and legal aspects. But necessary for business.
Referral and Incentive Programs: Encourage growth via referrals – e.g. invite friends and get a badge or some recognition, or even tangible rewards if budget (like swag for top referrers). Also possibly a system of reputation that encourages quality contributions (which indirectly drives retention and growth by having good content).
Internationalization: If expanding beyond English, implement i18n in UI and allow localized communities.
Federation or Decentralization options: If we consider competing with Reddit on principles, maybe consider ActivityPub federation (like Lemmy). This is a massive change; likely not in MVP, but could explore by M5 if strategic.
This milestone is more business-oriented, ensuring the platform not only grows but also starts to generate revenue to sustain itself. Each milestone builds on the previous, and critically, each one delivers a working, usable product that we could in theory deploy and test with users:
By Milestone 1, a basic Reddit clone in function (single-community mini-Reddit).
By Milestone 2, the full Reddit concept (multi-community, user moderation) is realized.
By Milestone 3, we've caught up to many modern social platform features (notifications, chats, rich media) making it truly engaging.
By Milestone 4 and beyond, we go beyond Reddit’s base offering with improved recommendations, gamification, and prepare to monetize and scale significantly.
We will continuously gather user feedback at each stage to adjust priorities. For example, if after M2 users clamor for a mobile app, we might start a lightweight Android app in parallel (using our existing APIs). Or if certain moderation features are heavily requested by early mod users, we can prioritize those in M3. The milestone plan is a guide, but we will maintain flexibility. Each milestone’s completion criteria include that the application is stable and performant with the new features and passes a regression test of earlier features (so we don’t break core functionality as we add more). By following this milestone-driven roadmap, we ensure structured growth of the platform: each phase solidifies the foundation and adds the next layer of functionality, allowing us to launch early and iterate with real user input, rather than trying to build everything at once.
