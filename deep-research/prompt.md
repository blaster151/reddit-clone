# Comprehensive Master Plan Prompt for Reddit Clone

You are tasked with constructing the most comprehensive master plan possible for our Reddit-like social media discussion site. This plan should resolve all technical ambiguities, define clear user roles, establish feature milestones, and create a detailed implementation roadmap.

## Technical Stack Resolution
Begin by analyzing our current technical stack and resolving all ambiguities. For each technology choice, provide:
- The specific version or configuration we will use
- Alternative options that were considered
- Detailed rationale for the final decision
- Integration points with other stack components
- Performance implications and scalability considerations

Cover all layers: frontend framework (Next.js), styling (Tailwind), state management, API architecture, database choice, authentication, testing strategy, deployment, and monitoring.

## User Types and Roles
Define comprehensive user personas including:
- Anonymous visitors (browsing capabilities)
- Registered users (basic posting and voting)
- Moderators (subreddit management)
- Administrators (platform oversight)
- Content creators (high-engagement users)
- Lurkers (read-only participants)

For each user type, specify their permissions, capabilities, limitations, and expected usage patterns.

## Feature Definition and Milestones
Create a comprehensive feature list organized into logical milestones. Each milestone should represent a deployable increment that delivers user value. For each feature, include:
- Detailed functional requirements
- User acceptance criteria
- Technical implementation notes
- Dependencies on other features
- Estimated complexity and effort
- Success metrics

Group features into 4-6 major milestones, each building upon the previous while maintaining a working application.

## Enhanced Charter
Expand our original charter into a comprehensive vision document that covers:
- Detailed use cases and scenarios
- Envisioned user journeys and workflows
- Competitive landscape analysis
- Unique value propositions and differentiators
- Target audience demographics and psychographics
- Success metrics and KPIs
- Monetization strategy considerations
- Community building and growth strategies

## Technical Implementation Roadmap
For each major technology component, create a detailed action roadmap with up to two levels of outlining. Each leaf node should be a specific, actionable task. Cover:
- Frontend architecture and component development
- Backend API design and implementation
- Database schema and data modeling
- Authentication and authorization systems
- Real-time features and WebSocket integration
- Search and discovery mechanisms
- Content moderation tools
- Performance optimization strategies
- Security implementation
- Testing infrastructure
- Deployment and DevOps pipeline
- Monitoring and analytics

## Critical User Flows
Define the top 30 most critical user flows that represent the core user experience. For each flow, specify:
- Triggering conditions
- Step-by-step user actions
- System responses and state changes
- Error handling scenarios
- Success criteria
- Performance requirements
- Accessibility considerations

## Innovative User-Facing Features
Propose three new user-facing ideas that would make our product significantly more compelling than existing alternatives. For each idea:
- Describe the concept and user value proposition
- Explain how it differentiates from competitors
- Outline technical feasibility and implementation approach
- Estimate development effort and timeline
- Define success metrics and validation criteria

## Implementation Strategy
Provide a comprehensive implementation strategy that includes:
- Team structure and role assignments
- Development methodology and processes
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Quality assurance and testing approaches
- Deployment and release management
- Performance and scalability planning
- Security and compliance considerations
- Maintenance and support strategies

## Success Metrics and Validation
Define comprehensive success metrics including:
- User engagement metrics
- Technical performance indicators
- Business and growth metrics
- Quality and reliability measures
- Security and compliance metrics

Include specific targets, measurement methods, and validation criteria for each metric.

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation
Identify potential risks across all dimensions:
- Technical risks (scalability, performance, security)
- Product risks (user adoption, feature complexity)
- Business risks (competition, market timing)
- Operational risks (team capacity, timeline)

For each risk, provide mitigation strategies and contingency plans.

## Resource Planning
Define resource requirements including:
- Team composition and skill requirements
- Infrastructure and tooling needs
- Third-party services and dependencies
- Budget considerations and cost estimates
- Timeline and milestone planning

## Deliverables
Your response should be structured as a comprehensive document with clear sections, detailed explanations, and actionable recommendations. Include visual elements where helpful (diagrams, flowcharts, timelines) and provide specific, measurable outcomes for each recommendation.

This master plan should serve as the definitive guide for all future development decisions and provide clear direction for achieving our vision of a compelling, scalable Reddit-like social media platform.
