## What modules/files will likely exist?

Given that this is a Reddit-like social media discussion site, you'll likely need these core modules:

Frontend/UI Modules:

- components/ - React components for posts, comments, voting, user profiles

- pages/ - Main pages (home, subreddit, post detail, user profile)

- hooks/ - Custom React hooks for data fetching, state management

- utils/ - Utility functions (like the sanitizeInput() mentioned in TODO)

Backend/API Modules:

- api/ - API routes and handlers

- models/ - Data models for posts, comments, users, subreddits

- services/ - Business logic layer

- middleware/ - Authentication, validation, etc.

Shared/Common:

- shared/validation.ts - Zod schemas (already mentioned in TODO)

- types/ - TypeScript type definitions

- constants/ - App constants

## What data shapes or contracts will I define?

Based on Reddit's core features, you'll likely define these data contracts:

User-related:

interface User {

 id: string

 username: string

 email: string

 karma: number

 createdAt: Date

 *//* *etc.*

}

Content-related:

interface Post {

 id: string

 title: string

 content: string

 authorId: string

 subredditId: string

 upvotes: number

 downvotes: number

 createdAt: Date

 *//* *etc.*

}

interface Comment {

 id: string

 content: string

 authorId: string

 postId: string

 parentCommentId?: string

 upvotes: number

 downvotes: number

 *//* *etc.*

}

interface Subreddit {

 id: string

 name: string

 description: string

 creatorId: string

 subscriberCount: number

 *//* *etc.*

}

Voting/Interaction:

interface Vote {

 id: string

 userId: string

 targetId: string

 targetType: 'post' | 'comment'

 voteType: 'upvote' | 'downvote'

 *//* *etc.*

}

## What kinds of tests should I expect?

Given the nature of a social media platform, you'll likely need:

Unit Tests:

- Validation logic (Zod schemas, sanitizeInput())

- Utility functions

- Business logic services

- Component rendering and interactions

Integration Tests:

- API endpoints (CRUD operations for posts, comments, votes)

- Authentication flows

- Database operations

- File uploads (if supporting images/media)

E2E Tests:

- User registration/login flows

- Creating and viewing posts

- Commenting and voting

- Subreddit creation and subscription

- Search functionality

Performance Tests:

- Load testing for high-traffic scenarios

- Database query optimization

- Caching strategies
